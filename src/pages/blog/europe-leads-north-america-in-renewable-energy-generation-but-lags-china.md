The Statistical Review of World Energy released on June 26 by the Energy Institute showed the EU leads North America in renewable energy generation for 2023. [[EI](https://email.cpg-online.de/t/d-l-vzddut-l-bkk/)] [[BP](https://email.cpg-online.de/t/d-l-vzddut-l-bku/)]

Previously published by BP from 1952-2022 until transitioning to the new institute supported by BP, the statistical report shows that European renewable energy generation was approximately 27 percent higher than North America at 1024 terawatt hours (TWh) for the year compared to North American solar and wind power generation of 817.8 TWh. China led the statistical ranking with 1367 TWh.

Europe added over 41 gigawatts of solar power in 2022, up 47 percent from 2021 according to the EC, and which the World Economic Forum credits with providing additional relief from the curtailment of Russian gas supplies.
